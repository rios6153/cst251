<h1>Lab 3 File Structure</h1>
<p> The idea of this lab was to further create a
	local file on my computer and add index.html files.</p>
	<h2> Challenges</h2>
		<p>It was easy creating the file structure but it took me
		a little while to organize it. Everything in general was just
		a bit time consuming but it was fun in general! Cool lab and partner!</p>
		<h3> Results</h3>
		<p>Here is the index.html file I created. Also Here
		is the file structure that I made:</p>
