	<h1>Lab 4 File Transfer</h1>
	<p> The idea of this lab was to further test our local files and then upload
	them to the server. </p>
		<h2> Challenges</h2>
			<p>It was easy creating the file index.html, and just
				adding the basic details. It was just a bit confusing
			how github works to see my labs but I figured it out, that was my challenged
		for this lab.</p>
			<h3> Results</h3>
			<p>Here is the index.html file I created.</p>
